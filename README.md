**[Project Name] - A Korean Learning Website for German Friends**

**Project Overview**

This project is a personal practice website built to help my German friends learn Korean. Developed with **React**, the site is designed to make learning fun and effective by immersing users in Korean culture. I honestly used **AI to assist** with the content ideas and site structure, which helped streamline the development process.

* **Motivation:** Seeing my German friends' desire to learn Korean, I wanted to create a more engaging learning environment for them. I decided to build a website that uses cultural content instead of dry textbooks, making language acquisition a more enjoyable experience.
* **Key Features:**
    * **Korean Folk Tales:** Learners can expand their vocabulary and understand context by reading these engaging stories.
    * **Ancient Korean Novels:** This feature allows users to explore the depth of Korean literature while learning advanced vocabulary and sentence structures.
    * **Typing Game:** An interactive game that helps users practice their Korean keyboarding skills, adding an element of fun to the study process.
